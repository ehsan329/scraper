# Cybersecurity Web Scraper and Code Analyzer

This project contains two Python scripts designed to scrape web content, download and analyze code for potential security vulnerabilities. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Enhanced Web Scraper**: This script uses Scrapy and Playwright to crawl a website, download its content, and extract inline JavaScript and CSS for analysis.
2. **Code Security Analyzer**: This script interacts with a generative AI model to analyze the downloaded code for vulnerabilities and generate a comprehensive security report.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
